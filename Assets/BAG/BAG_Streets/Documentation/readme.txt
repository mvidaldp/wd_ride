LODs
Shapes in the “Shapes” folder are the high quality version which have all the detail. Additionally, there are lower detail versions included in the LOD folder. The number at the end of each filename indicates  the LOD. The lower numbered files have more detail (1), with the lowest detail files having 3 (3) at the end of the filename.

LightMaps
To consolidate filesize, light maps are not included. To lightmap, make sure each object is marked static and “generate lightmap uvs” is check on the import settings.

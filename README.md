# Westdrive TAM ride

Modification of [Project Westdrive's original "AVAS" VR city ride](https://gitlab.com/fnnezami/project-westdrive/-/tree/MS-Wissenschaft?ref_type=heads) to [assess self-driving car acceptance using VR by Farbod Nosrat Nezami and Maximilian A. WÃ¤chter](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9781604).
This optimized modification allows simultaneous recording of head-tracking and eye-tracking ([using the HTC Vive Pro HMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Vive)), and EEG data while performing the experimental task. This simultaneous recording of data is achieved using [LSL (LabStreamingLayer)](https://github.com/sccn/liblsl).

All this work would not have been possible without the help of my colleague [Debora Nolte](https://github.com/debnolte).

## Introduction
### Important Notice:
For better ease of use, we have divided the project into two separate repositories, one containing 3d assets and a model called Westdrive Assets Foundation and the other
for functionalities of Westdrive which is called Westdrive Core. One can use these two repositories combined or separately to create their simulation outside the scope of 
scenarios existing in this version of Westdrive. 

you can find the [Westdrive Assets Foundation](https://gitlab.com/farbod69/westdrive-asset-foundation) here: https://gitlab.com/farbod69/westdrive-asset-foundation
and [Westdrive Core](https://gitlab.com/farbod69/westdrive-core) here : https://gitlab.com/farbod69/westdrive-core

## Testing Releases:

- You need only the latest Nvidia drivers and Steam VR
- the project has been tested on Nvidia 2080 Ti but should work with the minimum of GTX 1070 
- This version includes a connection to a web-based questionnaire. Since in this release, the questionnaire is not included. that part will be skipped. 
- the current version is based on the German language. This can easily be changed by changing the language to "ENG" in the config.ini file however part of the embedded audios for this release is only in German.

Note: 
The executable release is meant to be a showcase of Westdrive capabilities. Westdrive is meant to be customized and built for your specific needs. So we recommend you to download the code and build it yourself after implementing your own scenarios.

Note:
We still consider Westdrive in the beta phase, we are using it at its current state to gather data for our project, yet we are constantly working on the code to improve its stability and add new functionalities.

## Builded version
you can download the standalone version [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bBagKateS1WYV0HRvFxZbwWId148Rayk/view?usp=sharing)

## Build preparation
in the following section, it explains how you can clone and improve the project for build and development inside Unity environment.
### Step one: Preparing Unity
please [download](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) the corresponding version Unity and install it on your machine. It is highly recommended to 
download and install Unity through [Unity Hub](https://public-cdn.cloud.unity3d.com/hub/prod/UnityHubSetup.exe?_ga=2.187579435.2096600450.1550663193-640931691.1544444769).
It is easier to manage various installations of Unity when using Unity Hub. You can find more information on Unity Hub [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GettingStartedUnityHub.html).
#### notice:

> Please always make sure you are using the unity version mentioned here to ensure the correct build and functionality of Westdrive. 

### Step two: cloning the project
First, make sure you have installed a git client on your machine. If you need one you can find many of them online. Alternatively, you can just [download](https://desktop.github.com/) and install
the official GitHub client for Microsoft Windows. 
> If you just want to use Project Westdrive you can alternatively download the project as an archive file (see below), however, to contribute to the project or make your forks you will need a GitLab [account](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in#register-pane).

#### *
> This asset is used once and will be deleted once the city is updated with our assets but will be in use for the next year.

### ** 
> These assets are part of the city now but they will be replaced with the assets created by our team during next year and will be deleted from our repository then

### + 
> This asset is deprecated, we have deleted its functionality since it was not visible in VR and replaced it with normal audio output from the Taxi driver. This asset will be removed from our repository on our next commit.

## Avatars and animations:
Avatars and animations in Westdrive are created by us using Adobe Mixamo and Fuse cc. At the moment westdrive is using avatars of our creation using the mentioned tools but due to 
their complex mesh anatomy, we are replacing them with simpler low poly avatars created by us in Blender soon. 

### acknowledgment to creators and team assistants

Our acknowledgement goes to the creator of all free and paid assets mentioned above, Adobe, Unity Technologies, and Blenders for their tools as well as the following persons who helped us in creating and maintaining Westdrive
*  Phillip Spaniol - a main graphic designer in our team who is creating our new 3d models
*  Johannes Maximilian Pingle - helped to comment on part of the codes
*  Sumin Kim - helped to comment on part of the codes
*  Fabian Radke - working with ANN to convert head-tracking data to eye-tracking data within Westdrive

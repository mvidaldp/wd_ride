Modification of [Project Westdrive's original "AVAS" VR city ride](https://gitlab.com/fnnezami/project-westdrive/-/tree/MS-Wissenschaft?ref_type=heads) to [assess self-driving car acceptance using VR by Farbod Nosrat Nezami and Maximilian A. WÃ¤chter](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9781604).
This optimized modification allows simultaneous recording of head-tracking, eye-tracking, and EEG data while performing the experimental task.

This modification would not have been possible without the help of my colleague [Debora Nolte](https://github.com/debnolte).

## Introduction
### Important Notice:
For better ease of use we have devided the project into two seperate repositories, one containing 3d assets and model called Westdrive Assets Foundation and the other
for functionalities of Westdrive which is called Westdrive Core. One can use these two repositories combined or separetely to create their own simulation outside the scope of 
senarios existing in this version of Westdrive. 

you can find the [Westdrive Assets Foundation](https://gitlab.com/farbod69/westdrive-asset-foundation) here : https://gitlab.com/farbod69/westdrive-asset-foundation
and [Westdrive Core](https://gitlab.com/farbod69/westdrive-core) here : https://gitlab.com/farbod69/westdrive-core

## Testing Releases:

- You need only latest Nvidia drivers and Steam VR
- the project has been tested on Nvidia 2080 Ti but should work with the minimum of GTX 1070 
- This version includes a connection to a web-based questionnaire. Since in this release, the questionnaire is not included. that part will be skipped. 
- the current version is based on the German language. This can easily be changed by changing the language to "ENG" in the config.ini file however part of the embedded audios for this release is only in German.

Note: 
The executable release is meant to be a showcase of Westdrive capabilities. Westdrive is meant to be customized and built for your specific needs. So we recommend you to download the code and build it yourself after implementing your own scenarios.

Note:
We still consider Westdrive in beta phase, we are using it at its current state to gather data for our project, yet we are constantly working on the code to improve its stability and add new functionalities.

## Builded version
you can download the standalone version [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bBagKateS1WYV0HRvFxZbwWId148Rayk/view?usp=sharing)

## Build prepration
in the following section, it is explained how you can clone and improt the project for build and developement inside Unity environment.
### Step one: Preparing Unity
please [download](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) the corresponding version Unity and install it on your machine. It is highly recommended to 
download and install Unity through [Unity Hub](https://public-cdn.cloud.unity3d.com/hub/prod/UnityHubSetup.exe?_ga=2.187579435.2096600450.1550663193-640931691.1544444769).
It is easier to manage various installations of Unity when using Unity Hub. You can find more information on Unity Hub [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GettingStartedUnityHub.html).
#### notice:

> Please always make sure you are using the unity version mentioned here to ensure correct build and functionality of Westdrive. 

### Step two: cloning the project
First make sure you have installed a git client on you machine. If you need one you can find many of them online. Alternatively you can just [download](https://desktop.github.com/) and install
official Github client for Microsot Windows. 
> if you just want to use Project westdrive you can alternatively dowload the project as an archive file (see below), however to contribute to the project or make your own forks you will need a GitLab [account](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in#register-pane).

#### *
> This asset is used once and will be deleted once the city is updated with our assets but will be in use for the next year.

### ** 
> these assets are part of the city now but they will be replaced with the assets created at our team during the course of next year and will be deleted from our repository then

### + 
> this asset is deprecated, we have deleted its functionality since it was not visible in VR and replaced it with normal audio output from Taxi driver. This asset will be removed from our repository on our next commit.

## Avatars and animations:
Avaratars and animations in westdrive is created by us using Adobe Mixamo and Fuse cc. At the momenet westdrive is using avatars of our own creation using mentioned tools but due to 
their complex mesh anatomy we are replacing them with simpler low poly avatars created by us in blender soon.
